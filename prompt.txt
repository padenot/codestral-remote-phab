        "comment" : "In the third code block, you are using `nsAutoStringN<256>` instead of `nsString`. This is a good change as `nsAutoStringN<256>` is more efficient for small strings. However, you should ensure that the size of `tempString` does not exceed 256 characters, as `nsAutoStringN<256>` has a fixed size."
    }}
